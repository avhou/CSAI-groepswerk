"After reviewing the report, I did not find any absolute GHG emission reduction targets reported by Inditex Group. The company mentions its commitment to reducing emissions and achieving net zero emissions by 2040, but this is a target for carbon neutrality rather than an absolute emission reduction target. Additionally, the report highlights efforts to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 97% compared to 2018, but this is not an absolute emission reduction target as it does not specify a baseline year or a specific amount of emissions to be reduced."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any GHG emission intensity targets communicated by the company. The report only mentions absolute emission targets for 2030 and 2040, but does not provide any information on intensity targets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the company's intensity targets are in line with its absolute emission targets."
"According to the report, Inditex Group has set a target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. This is stated on page 4: 'Achieve net-zero emissions, reducing at least 90% of our carbon footprint with respect to 2018.' Additionally, the company's Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) submission for validation also mentions this target. Furthermore, the report highlights the company's commitment to using 100% renewable electricity at its own facilities, achieved in 2022. This suggests that Inditex Group has a clear company-wide net-zero emissions target."
"According to page 4, the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. This is also reiterated on page 5, where it is stated that the commitment is aimed at supporting the transformation of the sector and the textile industry through collaboration and innovation, with a target date of 2040."
"The company does not explicitly state that it plans to cut its absolute GHG emissions by 50% until 2030 at the latest. Instead, it mentions that it has submitted an updated strategy to the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for cutting its emissions associated with its business by over 50% by 2030 compared to 2018. This reduction is expected to help achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also targets a scope 3 20% reduction by 2027 compared to 2018, but this target does not specify an absolute reduction in GHG emissions."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any absolute emission reduction targets reported for scope 1 GHG emissions. The company only reports a combined target of net zero emissions by 2040, which includes scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Additionally, the report highlights efforts to reduce energy consumption and promote renewable energy sources, but these are not quantified as absolute emission reduction targets for scope 1 emissions."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any absolute emission reduction targets reported for scope 2 GHG emissions. The company only reports a combined target for scopes 1 and 3, but does not provide a separate target for scope 2 emissions. Therefore, I conclude that the company does not report its absolute emission target for scope 2 GHG emissions."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any absolute emission reduction targets reported for scope 3 emissions. The company only reports a combined target of achieving net zero emissions by 2040, which includes scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Additionally, the report highlights the company's commitment to reducing emissions associated with raw material extraction, but this is not a specific absolute emission reduction target for scope 3 emissions."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any specific interim targets for reducing GHG emissions. The company mentions its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and has submitted its strategy to the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for validation. However, it does not provide concrete interim targets for achieving this goal. Instead, it highlights its efforts to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 97% compared to 2018 and aims to achieve a 20% reduction in scope 3 emissions by 2027."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any explicit statement that the interim targets are in line with specific 1.5 degrees orderly sector transition pathways, which are based on frontloaded activities and no or limited emission overshoot. The company's Climate Transition Plan sets a target to reduce scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2027 compared to 2018, but it does not explicitly link this target to a specific pathway. Additionally, the report does not provide information on how the company's interim targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement or any other sector transition pathways."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any explicit statement from Inditex Group that they will use carbon credits and offsets exclusively for residual unabatable emissions or beyond value chain mitigation support. The report mentions the use of carbon prices to incentivize decarbonization (Page 25) and the development of emissions markets (Page 36), but it does not specify how these mechanisms will be used. Additionally, the report highlights the company's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 (Page 4), which may involve the use of carbon credits or offsets, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I conclude that Inditex Group does not explicitly state that they will use carbon credits and offsets exclusively for residual unabatable emissions or beyond value chain mitigation support."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any explicit statement that carbon credits and offsets will be only used when the company can ensure that the emission reduction or emission avoidance is sustained permanently. The report does mention the use of carbon credits and offsets (Page 25), but it does not provide any information about the sustainability of these reductions. Therefore, I conclude that the answer to this question is NO."
"The company explains its governance structure for managing the climate transition through various sources. On PAGE 18, it is mentioned that the Board of Directors conducts quarterly reviews to ensure that sustainability actions are aligned with the objectives. Additionally, on PAGE 16, the company outlines its framework for managing and disclosing risks and opportunities, which includes a risk management policy approved in 2020. Furthermore, on PAGE 34, the company explains how it manages climate risks through its Integrated Risk Management System. These sources suggest that the company has a governance structure in place to manage the climate transition."
"The company does not explicitly state how it ensures that the board members have the required skills to sign off and oversee the climate transition plan implementation. Although the report mentions that the Board of Directors conducts quarterly reviews to ensure alignment with sustainability-related matters, there is no specific information provided on the skills or expertise required for board members to effectively oversee the climate transition plan. The company's focus seems to be more on setting targets and committing to a low-carbon economy rather than providing details on how it ensures its board members are equipped to drive this change."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any information that explicitly mentions the company reporting its available in-house skills and additional capacity needs to implement the climate transition plan. While the report does mention the company's Climate Transition Plan and its goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it does not provide specific details on how the company plans to achieve these goals or what resources it will need to do so. The report does mention that the company has a network of internal and external specialists that analyzes the viability of the plan and the scope of each proposed action, but it does not provide information on what skills or capacity are needed to implement the plan."
"The company does not explicitly report a strategy on how it aims to fill the additional skill and capacity needs required to implement its climate transition plan. While it mentions investing in innovative projects that enact this change, it does not provide specific details on how it plans to address potential skill or capacity gaps. The report focuses more on the environmental improvement plans developed with suppliers and manufacturers in the supply chain, as well as measures to reduce energy consumption."
"Although the report mentions that the Board of Directors conducts quarterly reviews to ensure that sustainability actions are aligned with objectives, it does not explicitly state how the board oversees the implementation of the climate transition plan. The report only provides general information about the board's role in reviewing and approving sustainability-related matters, but it does not provide specific details on how the board monitors and evaluates the progress of the climate transition plan. Therefore, I would answer this question with 'no'."
"Although the report mentions that the Board of Directors conducts quarterly reviews, it does not explicitly state that these reviews include updates on the progress against achieving the climate transition plan targets. The closest mention is in section 6.1.5.1, where it says that the Sustainability Roadmap establishes goals for advancing towards a low-carbon economy and that the Board of Directors conducts quarterly reviews to ensure alignment with these objectives. However, this does not specifically mention the climate transition plan targets."
"Based on the report, it is not explicitly stated that a higher share of remuneration and bonuses are linked to the successful implementation of the climate transition plan interim targets compared to the general part of variable compensation for executives and managers. The report only mentions that the company has devised a variable remuneration system that links teams' remuneration to the attainment of the Company's objectives, including sustainability commitments (Page 35). However, it does not provide specific examples or percentages of climate-related variable compensation compared to non-climate related variable compensation. Therefore, I would answer the question with 'NO'."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any evidence that the climate transition plan targets have been subject to external assurance and validation. While the company mentions submitting its 2030 climate commitments and 2040 net zero emissions target to the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for validation, this does not necessarily imply that the entire climate transition plan has been externally assured and validated. Additionally, there is no mention of Second Party Opinions (SPOs) or third-party validations in the report."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any explicit statement from the company stating that it uses the same organizational boundaries for setting and achieving its climate targets as it does for financial accounting. The report mentions the company's commitment to sustainability and its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how it sets and achieves its climate targets. Additionally, the report only provides general information about the company's approach to managing and disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change, without providing specific details on how it sets and achieves its climate targets."
"Although the company provides some information on its climate strategy and transition plan, it does not provide comprehensive evidence that it fully integrates its climate strategy into its business strategy, product development, operations, financial and human resources, asset management and asset decommissioning. The report highlights the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net zero emissions by 2040, but it does not demonstrate how these targets are integrated into the core of the company's activities and management. For example, while the report mentions the company's variable remuneration system, which links employee remuneration to emission reductions, it does not provide details on how this system is implemented across different departments and levels of the organization. Additionally, the report does not provide information on how the company's climate strategy is integrated into its product development process or asset management practices."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any specific quantifiable subtargets that the company has identified to achieve their climate targets and climate key performance indicators. The report does mention targets such as net zero emissions by 2040 and a decarbonisation strategy, but these are high-level goals without concrete, measurable subtargets. The company's approach to risk assessment and scenario analysis is detailed, but it does not provide quantifiable subtargets for achieving their climate targets."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any information that suggests the company uses scenario envelopes to set targets and perform sensitivity analysis. The scenarios presented in the report are focused on assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, but there is no mention of using scenario envelopes to inform target-setting or resilience planning. While the company does use multiple scenarios to assess its climate risk exposure, it appears that these scenarios are not being used to set targets or perform sensitivity analysis."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find specific examples of strategic assumptions that form the basis of Inditex Group's transition plan. The report does mention interim milestones and estimated investment for reducing emissions, but it lacks concrete data or quantifiable information about the assumptions underlying its transition plan. The company's commitment to customers is mentioned, but this is more related to anticipating their demands rather than providing specific assumptions. Therefore, I would answer 'no' to the question of whether the company has reported its key assumptions that form the basis of its transition plan."
"The company reports a renewable energy strategy and activities, covering renewable energy build out, procurement, and consumption. The report highlights the company's commitment to generating and procuring energy from renewable sources, with specific examples of solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind energy, and geothermal energy generation. Additionally, the company mentions self-consumption initiatives, such as photovoltaic and wind power systems, which produce 7,049 MWh of electricity in 2023. The report also discusses the acquisition of Energy Attribute Certificates to support renewable energy consumption. Overall, the company's strategy and activities demonstrate a commitment to increasing renewable energy build out, procurement, and consumption."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any specific information about the company's strategy and activities for expanding and investing in climate solutions and climate solution technologies.

Therefore, I would answer the question as 'NO'."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any information that explicitly shows how the company plans to shift its capital expenditures (capex) to be aligned with its climate interim targets. Although the company has set ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, there is no specific mention of capex planning or alignment with these targets. The report does provide information on the company's sustainability commitments, including a roadmap for reducing emissions, but it does not provide details on how this will be achieved through capex planning."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any information that suggests the company has a strategy or plan to align its own revenues with its climate targets. The report focuses on the company's efforts to reduce emissions and promote sustainability, but it does not provide specific details on how it plans to shift away from net zero emissions misaligned sources of revenues. While the company mentions its commitment to customers and the importance of anticipating their demands in matters such as sustainability, this is not equivalent to a strategy for aligning its own revenues with climate targets."
"Although the report mentions the company's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, it does not specifically discuss how its Research and Development (R&D) activities are aligned with this target. The report highlights various initiatives and collaborations aimed at reducing emissions, but these efforts are not explicitly linked to R&D expenditures or activities. Therefore, based on the provided information, I would answer 'NO' to the question of whether the company reports its strategy and activities to align all its R&D activities with net-zero targets."
"The company reports a strategy with specific activities and metrics for success for net zero engagement with its upstream value chain, i.e. with its suppliers. The report highlights the importance of supplier engagement in achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Specifically, the company has developed environmental improvement plans that are implemented in collaboration with main facilities of suppliers and manufacturers in the supply chain.

The report also mentions specific metrics for success, such as a 20% reduction in water consumption by 2025 compared to 2020. Additionally, the company has implemented measures to provide lower impact consumption alternatives in its supply chain, including reducing energy consumption through an online platform accessible to the entire industry."
"The company does not explicitly report a strategy with specific activities and metrics for success for net zero engagement with its customers or investees. While the company mentions its commitment to customers and anticipates their demands in matters such as sustainability, this is not a specific strategy for engaging with customers or investees on net zero emissions. The company's focus seems to be more on its own operations and supply chain rather than direct customer or investee engagement."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any information that suggests Inditex Group actively engages with policy makers to advocate for specific climate policies. The company mentions its commitment to supporting the transformation of the sector and the textile industry through collaboration and innovation, but there is no evidence of direct advocacy efforts or public positioning for specific climate policies needed. The report focuses more on the company's internal actions and strategies rather than external policy engagements."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any specific activities with industry associations and industry groups where Inditex Group is a member, aligning its policy positions with net zero transition. Although the company mentions collaborations with external initiatives such as the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) and the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Foundation, these efforts do not specifically focus on industry associations' policy positions or net zero policies. The report does not provide information about Inditex Group's activities and specific policy goals that it advocates for within industry associations."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any specific information about consequences and escalation plans or activities if the company's engagement with suppliers, customers, policy makers, or industry associations is ineffective. The report does mention the importance of collaboration and stakeholder engagement in achieving its sustainability goals, but it does not provide a clear plan for escalating efforts if these engagements are unsuccessful. The company's Sustainability Roadmap and Climate Transition Plan do outline ambitious targets and actions aimed at achieving net zero emissions by 2040, but they do not specify what consequences or escalation activities would occur if these efforts are not successful."
"The company does not explicitly state that it has stopped or will immediately stop supporting additional fossil fuel exploration and extension of fossil fuel supply. Although the company mentions its commitment to phasing out coal, it only targets a near 100% reduction in emissions by promoting electrification and renewable energy. There is no mention of oil and gas, which are also forms of fossil fuels. The company's goal is to eliminate the use of coal in its supply chain by 2030, but this does not necessarily mean that it will stop supporting new exploration or extension of fossil fuel supply. Therefore, based on the information provided, I would answer 'no' to the question."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any evidence that suggests Inditex Group has committed to decommission or cancel all existing or planned fossil fuel projects. While the company mentions its efforts to reduce energy consumption and promote renewable energy sources in its supply chain, these initiatives do not necessarily involve the decommissioning of existing fossil fuel infrastructure. The report highlights specific collaborations and programs aimed at reducing emissions, but it does not provide a comprehensive strategy for decommissioning or canceling planned or existing fossil fuel projects."
"The company reports a strategy to phase out its use and support of fossil fuel consuming products and technologies. Specifically, it aims to eliminate the use of coal in its supply chain by 2030. Additionally, it has joined programs such as the Bangladesh Peer Action Group and Net Zero Pakistan to reduce emissions intensity in the textile industry. The company also mentions efforts to promote renewable energy sources and increase energy efficiency. While there is no specific time-bound goal for phasing out fossil fuel consuming products, the company's actions and commitments suggest a clear intention to transition away from these technologies."
"Upon reviewing the report, I did not find any specific strategy or activities mentioned by Inditex Group for a just transition. The company does mention its commitment to sustainability and reducing emissions, but these statements are general and do not provide a detailed plan for managing the impact of the net zero transition on its own workforce and indirectly affected workers and local communities. While the report touches on the importance of transparency and stakeholder engagement, it does not offer concrete measures to mitigate adverse impacts or ensure a fair and equitable transition."
"After reviewing the report, I did not find any specific information about developing just transition plans with the company's own climate transition-affected workforce, local communities, and relevant stakeholders. The report does mention the importance of involving customers in sustainability efforts and anticipating their demands, but this is a general statement rather than a specific plan. Additionally, there is no mention of collaborating with workers or local communities to manage the transition in a fair and equitable manner."
